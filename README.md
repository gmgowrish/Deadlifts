# Deadlifts

## Overview

This project utilizes computer vision and machine learning to analyze data using the following Python libraries:
- **OpenCV** (`opencv-python`): For computer vision tasks and image processing.
- **MediaPipe** (`mediapipe`): For real-time perception tasks like hand tracking and face detection.
- **NumPy** (`numpy`): For numerical computations and handling arrays.

## Installation

To set up the project environment, you need to install the required Python packages. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a brief guide on how to use the installed packages:

### OpenCV (`opencv-python`)

OpenCV helps with image and video processing. Example usage:

```python
import cv2

# Read an image
icap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

# Convert to grayscale
gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Display the image
cv2.imshow('Grayscale Image', gray_image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### MediaPipe (`mediapipe`)

MediaPipe is used for tasks such as face detection and hand tracking. Example usage:

```python
import mediapipe as mp

# Initialize MediaPipe Face Detection
mp_drawing = mp.solutions.drawing_utils
mp_pose = mp.solutions.pose

# Process an image
# For detailed usage, refer to MediaPipe documentation
```

### NumPy (`numpy`)

NumPy provides support for numerical operations. Example usage:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array
array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Perform operations
mean = np.mean(array)
print(f"Mean: {mean}")
```

## Deadlifts Explanation

**Deadlifts** are a foundational strength training exercise aimed at developing overall strength, particularly in the lower back, glutes, and hamstrings. Here's a brief overview:

### How to Perform a Deadlift:
1. **Starting Position**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, barbell over the middle of your feet.
2. **Grip**: Bend at the hips and knees, grasp the barbell with both hands, keeping your back straight.
3. **Lift**: Push through your heels, extend hips and knees to lift the barbell, keeping it close to your body.
4. **Finish**: Stand up straight with chest out and shoulders back, then lower the barbell back to the ground.

### Benefits:
- **Strength Development**: Targets lower back, glutes, hamstrings, and core.
- **Power**: Builds overall strength and power.
- **Posture**: Enhances posture and stability.

### Safety Tips:
- **Form**: Maintain proper form to avoid injury. Keep your back straight.
- **Weight**: Start with manageable weight and increase gradually.
- **Warm-up**: Warm up before performing deadlifts.
